                            I want to dig myself into the earth of writing and never come out,
                            <br> construct a cave of wods, sturdy enough to hold the ceiling
                            <br> and hide away.

                            <br> I’ll eat the dirt and scrape away at the hard soil.
                            <br> Grit under my nails, gathered in the cracks of my hands.
                            <br> I want to dig so deep I suffocate under all these pages.

                <p>(Where can you find a place
                    <br> to keep her, with all the huge strange thoughts inside you
                    <br> going and coming and often staying all night.)
                    <br> - Quote from Rilke poem, first elegy</p>

                <div class="body">
                    <p>I.
                        <br>We’re running together, Time and I, through the streets of our city. Our once-white sneakers squeak down the polished sidewalks and I can feel the sun painting my back red. Her body, always a step ahead, just out of reach. Her body, beautiful and electric, a silvery, sinewy study in dynamic girlhood. Suddenly, Time stops. In the moment I pass, she is within the reach of my soil-stained hands. I reach out to touch but my feet will not stop kicking and they carry me away from her into the next moment into something terrible and frightening and from behind, I hear her tell me to go on ahead, that she’ll catch up. I only turn my head soon enough to see her swallowed by the sun.</p>

                    <p>II.
                        <br> Time is ahead of me, her golden soles slapping the knotted concrete. It is dark and I could feel something breathing down my neck but I choose not to. There is only her, burning beacon in the dark, my solitary sweetheart. Suddenly, Time stops. I catch up but she tells me go ahead and I race forth into an unknown kaleidoscope, sacred shapes splayed out against darkness. I am not afraid. I am painted many colors that do not have names and watch myself grow infinitely large, as though dispersing in water. I keep her in my hands, my hair, slipped under my sternum. I keep her like sand in my hourglass hands, like shadows tucked under my heels. I keep her, sun on a string, in my empty body to keep me warm, to keep me running.</p>

                    <br>i am still caramels and chocolates
                    <br>but i wish you could have seen me
                    <br>grow into

                </p>
                <p>
                    i can still remember every wrinkle in
                    <br>your forehead
                    <br>the veins in your hands
                    <br>the depth of your laugh
                    <br>your spine, strong
                    <br>even after years of wear, decades of war
                </p>

                    papa
                    <br>when they put you in the ground
                    <br>i could not cry
                    <br>i had to save all of the salt
                    <br>in my body
                    <br>so that i could remain the sea
                    <br>salt caramels you so loved
                    <br>i didn’t want to fade away
                    <br>and become a ghost like you had
                    <br>become
                    <br>i wanted to keep every part of me that
                    <br>you loved intact so that
                    <br>one day you would be able to recognize me
                    <br>as an oak tree
                    <br>salt and iron
                    <br>glorious melanin
                    <br>a queen
                </p>
                <p>
                    you always talked to me about how
                    <br>energy cannot be created nor
                    <br>destroyed.
                    <br>when i walk into the sea, that is where
                    <br>your energy is most potent.
                    <br>That is where i feel
                    <br>most at home

                <h3>By Emma Pinksy</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="body">
                <p id="first">
                    <span>I</span> hated my indigo prom shoes and the way they rubbed my blisters. An empty Starbucks cup kept them company on the floor of Connor’s car as I sat on my knees and tugged countless bobby pins out of my wilted hair. Connor’s aqua dress shirt clashed magnificently with his fiery hair, which glistened even in the dark. On the way to Craig’s house we played Taylor Swift’s new album, quietly at first, then deafeningly while streetlights on the highway flew over and behind us. Inexplicably, we erupted into unprovoked laughter and did not stop until his eyes were red and my makeup smeared. I stuck my head out the window and smiled at the sky, bobby pins lost to the pavement. The air whistled by, until Connor’s ceaseless laughter became nervous and split as he called for me to come back inside the car. In the five seconds of silence between tracks he asked if I was okay. My polished nails fiddled with the lace on my dress, and he raised his eyebrows when I didn’t respond. The next track began to play, and we exploded once more in fits of giggles. I struggled to form a coherent answer. I don’t remember what I told him, but I do remember what he answered, with a chuckle and a grin.
                    <p>

                        <p>“Well, I’m here.”</p>

                        <h1>***</h1>

                        <p>
                            Infrequently do your role models become your friends, especially if you were like me: an awkward, gawky seventh grader complete with a retainer and two pairs of neon-colored Vans. Acutely aware of my uncool-ness, I lowered my head when Craig and his posse passed in the halls. Craig’s lanky frame, always clothed in American Apparel, would skitter through the school rehearsing choir harmonies surrounded by a constellation of well-dressed girls usually wearing floppy hats and toe rings. They were the elite. I was me. Eventually I ditched the retainer, gained some confidence, and became friends with Craig during our production of John Lennon and Me, a play about a children’s hospital. How our relationship evolved into road trips, sleepovers, and secrets, I don’t fully understand. During my freshman year—his senior year—our bond catapulted me into the Inner Circle, a world of driver’s licenses, college applications, and failed attempts to raid liquor cabinets.
                        </p>

                        <p>Craig is how I met Connor.</p>

                        <p>
                            I don’t remember actually meeting Connor, Craig’s boyfriend of four years, or many of the intermediate steps between being acquaintances and best friends. It’s as if we always were. Maybe because being friends with Connor was so effortless—I didn’t feel that I needed to impress him like I did the rest of the seniors. He called me Emmy-Em and held my hand when we walked downtown. We’d drive in his black Prius listening to horror movie soundtracks, then stop at Safeway to buy sandwiches or soup, depending on whether he was trying to be gluten-free that week. If it was dark we’d disclose our worries, bare our insecurities, and laugh about them in the end.
                        </p>


                        <h1>***</h1>

                        <p>
                            I chuckled when we walked through the automatic doors because it looked like an episode of Grey’s Anatomy. Clipboards, phones with a Code Blue button, and power-walking doctors in scrubs belonged on TV. My phone buzzed. “1435.” Connor’s room number. The elevator moved too fast, the lights were blinding, and the atmosphere of the fourteenth floor was flat. Pastel-colored printer paper sat placidly on the receptionist’s desk. She didn’t look up when we walked by. In other wings at UCSF Hospital, at least there was noise—children jabbering in pediatrics, doctors shouting in the emergency room, and monotone chatter on the general care floors. When we stepped out onto Connor’s floor it was silent, aside from the dull ding of the elevator.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I had been in the middle of my math homework when Craig called two months before to tell me the cancer was back. Stage four this time. Metastatic. Yes, they’re treating it. No, he won’t be answering his phone. I hung up—I’d gotten lunch with Connor a week before. Someone who drives you to lunch and sings along to Ke$ha can’t have cancer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was only real when I got to his room. Painfully real when I hugged Craig, cried in his arms, and held Connor’s hand. Most of his visitors were talking to him, sharing sunny stories and memories. I didn’t say much. I wasn’t sure what words to use. His family kept saying that there was a possibility he could hear our voices, even in the coma. Looking at his face, so tired and sick, I hoped more than anything it was true. Still, the words that had been orbiting in my brain for the last week seemed to fall flat. Even if he could hear me, I thought, what would he want me to say?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The view from his room looked like a postcard. The Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco skyline, and Pacific Ocean. Connor wore a dark green beanie—the same one he wore when he bought my mom flowers so she would extend my curfew. An hour passed before it was time to leave. I squeezed his hand and whispered my carefully selected words in Connor’s ear. If he did hear them, I wanted those sentences to be private—just between us.
                        </p>

                        <h1>***</h1>

                        <p>
                            The day Connor passed, Craig and I drove with the windows down. We sang mindlessly with the radio through windblown hair. Taylor Swift came on. I smiled, and listened.
                        </p>

                        it was one of those rainy days when you remember that one subway train you were pushed onto in new york city, and the man with dreadlocks playing music through his headphones so loudly each moment was a meteor shower. you remember your hands, how you tried to bury yourself into the creases, because falling into a stranger’s eyes would have been too thrilling, too dangerous. and you remember your reflection, how your nose carved its way through your face like a lone mountain, and how your cheekbones caved in like valleys, stained with storms. and the more you stared at yourself, the more you disappeared. you wondered if God was watching you, and if he knew how lonely you were. you wondered if he was there, on the train, and wanted to have a cigarette with you, and if he ever felt like he was fading. and it was one of those rainy days when you realize you are always falling in love with strangers, & songs, & subway trains, but never yourself.

                    <h1>BIG FORKS</h1>
                    <h3>By Gabby Bonfiglio</h3>
                </div>

                <div class="body">
                    <img id="butter" src="img/bonfiglio_butter.jpg">
                    <p>
                        Butter always comes first. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably a phony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is best at room temperature, but the baker knows that setting butter out the night before is a lofty goal reserved for Julia Childs, or others who have their shit together. I always microwave my butter for sixteen seconds, on high, so that is just softened for mixing. Once, I accidentally melted a whole stick so it bled all over the microwave, and it took me forever to scrub off the melted mess. My dad yelled at me the next day because the plate was still greasy and I hadn’t put it away, and I melted, too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today I unwrap the butter and it falls into the metal mixing bowl. Two sticks, thud, thud. Next is always sugar. Sugar must be mixed thoroughly with the butter, and so I measure it half cup by half cup but not too carefully, the grains heaping on one side and thinning on the other unevenly, an idea I am used to from looking in the mirror. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grab a fork to mix with. My mom and three younger sisters like to say this is pointless because we have both a hand mixer and a standing mixer in our bright and spacious and well-stocked kitchen. But I always use a fork. I want to labor over the cookies, to put all my muscle into the motion of birthing a beautiful ball of dough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today’s fork is a “big fork,”  in contrast with a “little fork.”  We have two sets because my dad does not like to eat with a utensil that is too light for his Italian grip.
                    </p>
                    <img id="bowl" src="img/bonfiglio_bowl.jpg">
                    <p>
                        I mix and mix, my arm bulging in its slow circles against the butter’s smooth resistance. I wonder if my bicep is too big and think that at least I’m putting it to use. Slowly the butter and sugar become an endearing, creamy mass, and I taste it, momentarily pretending the raw fat and sugar won’t settle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eggs next. I crack three and scoop out a piece of shell because my dad might be eating these. More stirring, now, and then what I call in my head the “ little ingredients”—salt, vanilla extract, baking soda, baking powder, sometimes cinnamon because this kitchen is mine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am pouring one teaspoon of vanilla extract—a husky ingredient important for its flavor—when my dad loudly pushes his chair out from the high marble counter and leaves the kitchen with a “ See you later, Gab.”  I have been giving him his space and he mine. Usually this is his house and he occupies wherever his thick stature pleases. But he knows this kitchen is my own today and whenever I choose to bake—to create something beautiful, to let inaccurately measured flour become my biggest worry, to reclaim. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Love you,”  I reply as I add a teaspoon of salt and smile as the flakes fall and glisten on the mixture like the white flurry in our backyard. Salt brings out the sweetness and flavor of a baker’s masterpiece, and so I always add a little extra.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It takes me until after the baking powder to realize that my dad has left his plate, and his cold cuts, and his cup, and his big fork. He did this yesterday, too, and I watched my mom clean it up, and the day before and the week before the same. Each of my three younger sisters has taken a turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now the sight stops my rhythmic mixing, and I confront this mess. It is in my kitchen and asking to be cleaned up, supposing I the daughter be the one to do it. So I do, slowly, and each utensil and bit of food feels heavier. I wipe away the crumbs on the dark countertop—imperfections.
                    </p>
                    <img id="dough" src="img/bonfiglio_dough.jpg">
                    <p>
                        Flour is next, the second to last ingredient. With these two cups comes a new and fierce blizzard, and I pick up my fork and begin to stir strongly. Around and around and around and despite my force some of the flour just isn’t mixing but forming streaks across dough. I drop my fork and it clangs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In go my hands. I thrust them into the dough and I’m almost up to my elbows in it and I love the feeling. I knead and knead and feel the dough between my fingers and keep going until I can breathe again. It is now a pale beige color somewhere between firewood and snow, and I think it is beautiful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        True bakers know never to overmix, not to worry about the little lumps and bumps left in our batter or dough. Overmixing and overanalyzing leads to a tough and tired and bitter product. I continue to breathe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chocolate chips are last. I learned recently that a woman invented chocolate chip cookies, and I’m not sure why that surprised me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tip the bag and let the chips pour, rushing into the bowl. My dad likes to tell me that I don’t use enough chocolate chips, on the odd chance that he eats my masterpiece. I pour more. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dough is stuck between my pinky and ring finger, and under my nails, and around the ponytail holder on my wrist I forgot to take off, and I continue mixing with my hands, relishing the mess that is mine.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Teaspoon-sized”  is what all the recipes say dough balls should be, but in my kitchen there is no ideal. I shape a diversity of dough and plop them in disarray on my tray, plop, plop, popping a bite into my mouth with every other ball I shape. My mom and sisters like to tell me I eat too much when I bake, and today their voices echo in my empty kitchen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I eat one more bite of the gooey, smooth, sweet dough and smile spitefully. My dad strolls back into the kitchen. 
                    <p>
                        “Dad, you forgot to clean your plate again.”  The words escape before I’ve swallowed, and I almost choke. I wait for a reply and try to stand taller, but I’m shaking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He looks at me for a second, frozen, with a streak of flour on my forehead and cookie dough on my hands and in my mouth—his striving daughter. His expression stumbles its way from indignant to understanding. “Oh, I’m sorry.”
                    <p>
                        I nod. Today, that’s all I need

                <h3>By Ben Kesslen</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="body">
            <p>
                <span>On the third floor</span> I told my professor that my essay was going to be late because I didn’t feel like I could do anything that week.
            </p> 
            
            <p>
                <span>On the second floor</span> I went on a date with a boy who brought me a mocha in a mason jar and listened to me when we talked and kissed me on my lips on our walk home—and then a couple weeks later decided he didn’t like me anymore but never had the courage to tell me to my face so instead I heard it from my friend who I often do homework with in the computer lab that is 50 feet away from the room where he and I laughed together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the first floor</span> I read a story about my queerness to my freshman writing seminar in a way I never thought I would be able to, and I fled to the bathroom one time when I almost ran into a person who I wished would leave this school—or at least go abroad for a year—and I sat on the toilet with my pants on and thought about how the basement floor bathroom is the nicest part of the building and how the tiles surrounding me were the ones they often use in the HGTV renovation shows that I would watch alone on Saturday nights in high school. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the second floor</span> I ate pizza and Chinese food and Hot Cheetos late into the night with my friends as we used homework as our excuse to spend time together that we didn’t get during the day, and I cried to my mom on facetime audio because the sound quality is better and I missed her voice, and I wrote an essay about a book I didn’t read. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the third floor</span> I tripped and spilled the free drink I got from The Rez—it had two shots of espresso because I didn’t really sleep the night before and I’m not really sure why. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the second floor</span> I stared at my reflection in the computer monitor as the boy I liked did coke in the seat next to me so he could finish a paper, and I sat in the lab late into the night on a Thursday not doing my work, just looking up at the high ceiling, giving myself space to breathe after a week that had felt like eternity, when everything seemed like it was too much to handle and I wanted to run away but I couldn’t so instead I just took refuge in the place with the high ceilings and the large windows and the Macs that don’t work well and the printers that take forever to produce a two page, double-sided reading response and the security guard whose name I forget but always smiles at me.
            </p> 
             
            <p>
                <span>On the first floor</span> I ate a free lunch for American Studies majors. There was a lot of guacamole and I sat there for 90 minutes until I was so full I couldn’t move. And I took a selfie in the mirror of that bathroom that seems too nice for the rest of the building that made me feel good about myself in a way I hadn’t in a while. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the third floor</span> I dropped a class, and I changed my home on GrubHub to “Eaton Hall, 5 The Green, Medford, MA 02155.” Only the drivers from Golden Light can find it but I always try anyways because I don’t want to walk all the way to the Campus Center when I order food.
            </p>  
            <p>
                <span>In the staircase</span> I heard a straight boy say the word “faggot” but stayed silent because I was wearing leggings that day.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the first floor</span> someone told me that over the summer they want to renovate Eaton and make it look like 574 Boston Ave, turn it into some STEM circle-jerk like they are doing to the rest of this school. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>On the second floor</span> I wrote this as I was the only one left in the computer lab. On the way out the security guard smiled at me.

                <h1>DON'T TELL</h1>
                <h3>By Tess Ross-Callahan</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="body">
            <p>
                I never told anyone that the first night my son came home with a boy, I didn’t speak to him for three weeks.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The second time, I threw him out of the house. 
                You have to understand, I wasn’t raised to talk about things. Talking, talk talk talk, it’s all over the news now as the trademark of good parenting: talk about it. <i>Talk to your son about his behavior. Have you talked to your son lately? Honey, someone’s got to talk to that boy. </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Talk.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The way I was raised, the surefire way to make a bad situation worse was to talk about it. Even asking my dad about his day could get you a licking. Whenever my mama insisted we eat dinner together, my dad would read <i>The Montgomery Advertiser</i> out loud between bites. Sometimes we’d discuss Kenny’s football game, but mostly we just listened to Daddy read about what ass-backwards decisions the liberals had just made in Congress. I never told anybody about my boyfriend Fred until he proposed. Even then, the only question my dad asked was how much Fred made, not all those questions you see on TV nowadays about what’s he like or does he treat you right and all that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So I sure didn’t tell Fred when our son started talking about Prince Erik instead of Princess Ariel. I was never real sure about God, but Fred went to church every Sunday, and I didn’t want any trouble. So I tried, I really did. I gave Kyle all those books about God making the sunrise and I told him about the right way to fall in love and he was better at first, I swear. He even stopped drawing Prince Erik in art class. And I thought there was nothing else to worry about, that we’d sidestepped the crisis and that my boy was on the right track. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And then, fifteen years old, he came home with Richie Baker from algebra. No problem, I always feed my boy’s friends from school, I just buy beans instead of meat the next week. Fred might’ve complained, but Kyle had been so quiet, so isolated. I was glad to see him with a friend.  
            </p>
            <p>
                But when I went up to ask the boys to set the table for supper, they weren’t doing algebra at all. No, their backpacks were lying untouched on the rug like fat, dead birds, and they were lying on the bed together. I hadn’t seen so much of my boy since I’d been teaching him to wash his privates. And there they were, under my roof! Right under my nose!
            </p>
            <p> 
                They saw me and sprang apart like the little boys they were, and Kyle scrambled for the blankets. “Ma - ” 
            </p>
            <p>
                But I had nothing to hear from him. I told Richie he’d best leave this very minute, and I went downstairs and thought about burning the sausage, just so something would suffer for this sin. But in the end, I didn’t burn anything. I made that meal the best I’d ever made it, throwing my heart into my work, and it was so good that Fred commented on it when he got home. Kyle, though, didn’t eat a thing. He sat with his chin dipping towards his chest, his cheeks Alabama crimson. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And I didn’t say a word to him the whole meal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, I just didn’t know how to stop. Kyle would come home from school and hover in corners, twisting his shirt between his fingers like he’d done as a little boy, and he’d say, “Ma, I think we ought to talk about this,” and “Ma, why aren’t you answering me?” But I never learned how to talk. So it stayed that way until he said, “Ma, are you going to tell Dad?” 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Tell him what?” It just came out.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Kyle dropped his head and pulled at the loose thread in his sweatshirt until it ripped. His mouth looked like it wanted to smile, but his eyes looked like the dark holes in the soil after I’d dug up my pansies — too empty to even be a grave. He walked out of my kitchen without a word, and just like that, we were on speaking terms again. I thought that was the end of it, but these things send out deep roots. Cutting off the head only slows them down.
            </p> 
            <p>
                When he came home for the first time from UC Berkeley, his father was out. When I opened the door, he was standing on the doorstep with another boy gripping his hand. Kyle’s face was not my son’s face. Older, without the small pouches of baby fat weighing down his cheeks, but it was more than that. The hem of his shirt wasn’t wrinkled or full of holes, and he held himself upright without needing to be reminded.  
            </p>
            <p>
                But I barely noticed these changes at the time, because I was looking their twisted-up hands hanging between them, and all I could think about was Faerie Daryl from my neighborhood, and what had happened to him, and how the blood stained the concrete for four whole months before the mayor finally ordered it painted over.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn’t close the door. I meant to, but I was stuck, staring, and now Kyle’s face looked the way it did when he was confronting the ref about a particularly bad call: scared and angry and determined, all at once. He wouldn’t leave, even when I told him to, and he kept trying to talk to me - talk talk talk - and finally I couldn’t stand it anymore, that word talk burning and pricking me like a bad fever, so I said it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “You aren’t welcome here until you beat this sickness back for good.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                And something in my boy’s face closed, somehow. He turned pale and bitter as gin, and he turned, still with that goddamn stranger clutching his hand, and they got in his truck and drove away.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When I got the phone call after the Stonewall Riots, I didn’t cry. I made a sausage dinner. I made it perfect, absolutely perfect, and it was only much later that I found myself choking on my dinner and spitting it into the sink. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                “What’s wrong, Elsie?” 
            </p>
            <p>
                I almost told him, but how do you tell your husband that his son was in the gay riots in California when your husband thinks his son is still in Alabama, maybe with a nice girl? How do you tell him that his son is paralyzed in a hospital and probably has a boy sitting at his bedside? 
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think I burned the sausage,” I told him, and put my napkin back in my lap. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Talking. I never did learn how to do it.

                Due to its salience as a symbol for San Francisco, the Victorian house is an obvious choice for an emblem to represent SF housing. Due to its opulent, vibrant, and colorful exterior, the Victorian house is also a potent symbol for distraction. The ornate Victorian facade is a perfect metaphor for the way in which the superficial San Francisco landscape camouflages the heart-wrenching realities of foreclosure and eviction playing out every day in the city. All of SF’s primary attractions (including the tech boom, the Golden Gate Bridge, the myriad lush parks, the incredible vantages, and the pleasant drought weather), along with the beautiful Victorian housing scattered throughout the city, make up a gleaming yet thin veneer that prevents many from seeing what’s really going on.

                Whenever a neighborhood is gentrified or “cleaned up,” underprivileged people like the homeless are mercilessly and inhumanely mistreated and dehumanized. They are unfairly discriminated against because of aspects of their identity and appearance beyond their control, such as their personal hygiene. They are seen as an unsightly infestation, much like pigeons.
            </p>
            <p>
                A large reason why I chose to base my artwork on the current SF gentrification crisis was because I felt an overwhelming obligation to educate myself about SF’s past and current histories relevant to the issue.

                    4:15. You polish sunlight<br>
                    through the bottom of a glass<br>
                    while I fold napkins<br>
                    and tell me about the mountains<br>
                    scrapping across Telluride blue,<br>
                    the girls you dated in college,<br>
                    that dream you had last night. <br>

                    The sauvignon-blanc ladies get your dimples,<br>

                    Scared, sixteen. On the first day <br>
                    you took the seat next to mine. <br>
                    Can’t let you monopolize all that space.<br>
                    During the worst shifts, you gave me<br>
                    maraschino cherries. Cancer<br>
                    Pills, you called them.<br>

                    this page with sappy quotes<br>
                    under pictures of sunsets and birds.<br>
